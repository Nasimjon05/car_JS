🚗 JavaScript OOP Program: Car Simulator
This program defines a Car class with basic functionality like starting the engine, driving, and checking the fuel level — perfect to demonstrate OOP in JavaScript.

class Car {
  constructor(brand, model, fuel = 100) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.model = model;
    this.fuel = fuel;
    this.engineOn = false;
  }

  startEngine() {
    if (this.fuel > 0) {
      this.engineOn = true;
      console.log(`${this.brand} ${this.model}'s engine is now ON.`);
    } else {
      console.log("Not enough fuel to start the engine.");
    }
  }

  drive(km) {
    if (!this.engineOn) {
      console.log("Start the engine first!");
      return;
    }

    const fuelNeeded = km * 0.2; // 0.2 liters per km
    if (fuelNeeded <= this.fuel) {
      this.fuel -= fuelNeeded;
      console.log(`You drove ${km} km. Fuel left: ${this.fuel.toFixed(1)} liters.`);
    } else {
      console.log("Not enough fuel to drive that far.");
    }
  }

  refuel(liters) {
    this.fuel += liters;
    console.log(`Added ${liters} liters of fuel. Total: ${this.fuel} liters.`);
  }

  showStatus() {
    console.log(`🚗 ${this.brand} ${this.model} | Fuel: ${this.fuel}L | Engine: ${this.engineOn ? "ON" : "OFF"}`);
  }
}

// 🔧 Example Usage
const myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla");

myCar.showStatus();       // Check status
myCar.startEngine();      // Start the car
myCar.drive(50);          // Drive 50 km
myCar.refuel(20);         // Add 20L fuel
myCar.drive(200);         // Try to drive again
myCar.showStatus();       // Final status
🧠 Concepts Covered:
class and constructor()

Object properties & methods

Encapsulation (using methods to control behavior)

Real-world simulation of a car

Would you like a README.md for this one too? Or maybe convert it into a web app version with a simple UI? Let me know! 😄

Of course! Here's a simple and clean README.md file for your JavaScript OOP Car Simulator — perfect for a beginner-friendly GitHub project. 🚗💨

# 🚗 Car Simulator (JavaScript OOP)

This is a beginner-friendly **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** project written in **JavaScript** that simulates a simple car system. It helps you understand how classes, objects, and methods work in real-life scenarios.

---

## 🧠 Features

- Create a car with brand, model, and fuel level
- Start the engine (only if fuel > 0)
- Drive the car (consumes fuel based on distance)
- Refuel the car
- Show current status (brand, fuel, engine)

## 💡 How It Works

- Each car is an **object** created from the `Car` **class**.
- The `drive()` method calculates fuel usage based on kilometers.
- The `refuel()` method adds fuel.
- The `startEngine()` method turns on the engine if there's fuel.

---

## 🚀 Example Usage

```javascript
const myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla");

myCar.showStatus();       // Shows brand, fuel, engine status
myCar.startEngine();      // Starts engine if fuel > 0
myCar.drive(50);          // Drives 50 km (uses 10L)
myCar.refuel(20);         // Adds 20L of fuel
📚 OOP Concepts Used
Concept	Example
Class	class Car { ... }
Constructor	constructor(brand, model, fuel)
Object	const myCar = new Car(...)
Method	startEngine(), drive(), etc.
Encapsulation	Controlled access to object state

✅ Requirements
